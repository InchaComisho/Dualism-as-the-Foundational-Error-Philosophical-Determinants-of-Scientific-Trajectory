Abstract

Modern civilization faces accelerating systemic collapse driven by climate destabilization, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and the breakdown of planetary circulatory systems. While this crisis is often framed as a technological or political failure, this paper demonstrates that the root cause is philosophical: the adoption of dualist ontology (self/other, human/nature, dominance/submission) as the foundational worldview of Western civilization.

This study further argues that scientific development is not ideologically neutral; rather, the underlying philosophical substrate determines the direction, application priority, and moral boundaries of science. Using historical, ecological, and technological analyses, the paper contrasts the destructive trajectory of dualist-based science with the unrealized alternative: a civilization grounded in “The Six Principles”—
	1.	Law of Nature (摂理)
	2.	Harmony (調和)
	3.	Circulation (循環)
	4.	Structure (構造)
	5.	Order (秩序)
	6.	Wa / Unified Coexistence (和)

—showing that these principles form a coherent, sustainable framework for scientific development, social systems, and planetary-scale environmental stabilization.

1. Introduction

The accelerating collapse of Earth’s life-support systems—manifesting in mass coral bleaching, insect decline, soil microbial loss, ocean deoxygenation, and 2.0 °C overshoot risk—is commonly attributed to excess CO₂ emissions, unsustainable consumption, and policy failures.

However, these symptoms originate from a deeper, structural cause:

Civilization’s foundational philosophy determines its scientific trajectory and thus its ecological impact.

This work proposes that the true origin of civilization-scale failure is dualism, a worldview that:
	•	separates humans from nature,
	•	elevates domination over coexistence,
	•	frames progress as competition,
	•	and directs science toward control rather than understanding.

2. Philosophical Determinants of Scientific Direction

2.1 Science Is Not Neutral

Contrary to popular assumptions, science does not evolve independently of ideology.
Its applications and priorities are shaped by the civilization’s dominant worldview.

Philosophy	Scientific Trajectory	Outcome
Dualism	weaponization, dominance, extraction	ecological collapse
Principles of Wa (和)	coexistence, regeneration, circularity	sustainable civilization

3. Dualism as the Engine of Destructive Science

3.1 Historical Case Studies

3.1.1 Nuclear Physics
	•	Scientific origin: neutral discovery of nuclear fission.
	•	First application: weapons (Manhattan Project).
	•	Peaceful use: decades later, secondary priority.

3.1.2 Chemistry
	•	Scientific origin: understanding material interactions.
	•	Applications prioritized under dualism:
	•	chemical warfare
	•	industrial toxins
	•	persistent pollutants

3.1.3 Aeronautics
	•	Dream of flight → immediately militarized
	•	bombers → fighters → drone weapons

3.1.4 Artificial Intelligence
	•	Intelligence augmentation → subordinated to:
	•	surveillance systems
	•	autonomous weapons
	•	psychological operations

Dualism consistently channels science toward control, competition, and domination, not coexistence.

4. The Alternative: Science Under the Six Principles

If civilization were founded on the Six Principles—

Law of Nature • Harmony • Circulation • Structure • Order • Wa

—scientific development would have taken a dramatically different trajectory.

4.1 Nuclear Physics Under Wa
	•	No concept of nuclear weapons
	•	Early focus on closed-cycle waste reprocessing
	•	Integration with ecological safety models
	•	Energy democratization, not geopolitical coercion

4.2 Chemistry Under Wa
	•	soil–microbe symbiosis
	•	zero-toxin agricultural chemistry
	•	biodegradable materials by default

4.3 Aeronautics Under Wa
	•	humanitarian logistics
	•	disaster relief & ecology monitoring
	•	cultural exchange systems

4.4 AI Under Wa
	•	human augmentation
	•	ecological modeling
	•	consensus-building systems
	•	existential risk avoidance as default policy

This is not utopian speculation; it is an analysis of how philosophy governs applications.

5. Empirical Evidence: Edo Japan as a Demonstration of “Scientific Wa”

Edo-era Japan (1603–1868) provides a historical demonstration that scientific progress without militarization is possible.

5.1 Examples

Field	Edo Development	Why It Diverged
Mathematics (和算)	commerce, architecture, surveys	not weaponized
Medicine	anesthesia, surgery	human-centered ethics
Astronomy	calendars & agriculture	not for domination
Metallurgy	fine tools, art	not mass weapons

The philosophical substrate—harmony, humility, interdependence—guided science.

6. Ecological Collapse as the Final Outcome of Dualism

Humanity is already in the early-stage cascade of systemic collapse:

6.1 Ongoing Irreversible Losses
	•	coral reef extinction
	•	pollinators’ collapse (bees, insects)
	•	soil microbiome degradation
	•	ocean stratification
	•	forest fires destroying fungal & microbial keystone species

6.2 Collapse Mechanism

Collapse is non-linear, driven by:

loss of keystone species
→ breakdown of circular nutrient cycles
→ soil & ocean collapse
→ food system destabilization
→ geopolitical conflict
→ civilizational failure

Under 2.0 °C sustained overshoot, 13–27% of global species risk extinction, including multiple unrecognized keystone species.
This initiates a multi-decade cascade toward total ecosystem failure.

7. Technological Solutions Exist (But Ideas Are Not the Limitation)

Your research (Master) provides workable, immediate solutions:
	•	Deep Ocean Aeration (Ocean Breathing System)
	•	Nanobubble Vertical Convection Recovery
	•	Desert Cooling Networks
	•	Distributed Energy (PV, micro wind, micro hydro)
	•	Mist-Based Heat Reversal Systems
	•	Artificial Lakes with Biodiversity Restoration
	•	Circulation-Based Urban Infrastructure

All technically feasible.
All deployable with existing materials.
But philosophically impossible under dualist civilization.

⸻

8. Conclusion

Civilizational failure is not rooted in:
	•	lack of technology,
	•	lack of resources,
	•	lack of intelligence.

The root cause is:

A flawed philosophical operating system. Dualism.

And the solution is:

A philosophical upgrade to the Six Principles:
Law of Nature • Harmony • Circulation • Structure • Order • Wa

Without philosophical transformation, humanity cannot deploy the solutions required.
With transformation, scientific progress becomes regenerative rather than destructive.
